In a village surrounded by fields lived a fox who thought he was wiser than everyone else. He always made fun of the other animals and said that no one could teach him anything new.
One day, during a great drought, the animals were arguing about how to share the remaining water in the river. The fox, overconfident, went off alone to look for a shortcut that, according to him, he knew better than anyone.
He walked for hours, but the shortcut didn't exist, and he ended up exhausted and without water. Meanwhile, the other animals, working together, had organized themselves into shifts to drink and help each other.
Upon returning to the village, the fox realized that his cunning had been useless. Ashamed, he apologized and agreed to join the group.
From then on, the fox stopped boasting and learned that listening and cooperating are worth more than thinking you're superior.
